Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes to structure software. 
Java is an object-oriented language, and it supports the following OOP concepts:

Class: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a datatype by bundling data 
and methods that work on the data into one single unit.

Object: An object is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated until an object is created.


class Dog {
    String breed;
    int age;
    String color;

    void barking() {
        System.out.println("The dog is barking");
    }

    void hungry() {
        System.out.println("The dog is hungry");
    }

    void sleeping() {
        System.out.println("The dog is sleeping");
    }
}
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog myDog = new Dog(); 
        myDog.breed = "Bulldog";
        myDog.age = 5;
        myDog.color = "Brown";
        myDog.barking();
    }
}
